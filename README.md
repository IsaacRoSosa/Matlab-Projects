# Magnetic Field Visualization of a Current-Carrying Ring üß≤
It calculate and graph the magnetic field produced by a ring along the z/y axis. The code allows for variations in current, ring radius, and vector quantities, providing a visual representation of the magnetic field generated by the ring.
